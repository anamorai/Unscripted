# Unscripted

Staying organised is no easy task, that’s why we’ve created the productivity manager.

With the productivity manager, you can plan your next exercise for any part of the body, get your next meal stirring with recipe ideas, and keep track of your day-to-day tasks with the configurable to do list.

We made this dashboard to help you keep on top of your fitness, plan your next meal, and keep yourself organised.

## Installation

To open the project please follow this link: 

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Usage
